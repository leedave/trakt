# Trakt Interface #

A web interface that connects to the API of the Movie/TV Show scrobbler Trakt 

Trakt is a cool tool, that can be used in combination with media players such 
as Kodi, VLC, Plex etc. to keep track of what Movies/Shows you own, when you 
watched them and how you rated them. 

This App connects with Trakt and allows you to download your data. You can also rate
Movies / TV Shows and set view dates. You can integrate this in your Web Application.
